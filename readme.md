Nxs

**A versatile web interface for the official Nxt Client for the Nxt cryptocurrency**

Nxs, pronounced "Nexus" as Nxt is pronounced "Next", is a modified version of the default NRS web app of the official Nxt client that includes many new features and a more modern design. Some of Nxt's features include:

- a jQuery solution for loading separate HTML views, rather than the `<iframe>` tag solution of the original client
- Zurb Foundation 5 as the CSS base
- Handlebars JS templates which prevent the need for HTML markup within the JS files
- Ability to use keyboard shortcuts to lock/unlock accounts, send Nxt, and more...
- A very clean, compartmentalized folder structure to make customization easy
- Ability to set a language for labels and messages (language text can be customized by modifying JSON files)
- Ability to show a hint on the `Unlock Account` dialog
- Ability to display a QR code of the currently unlocked account
- Ability to filter transactions by sent, received, confirmed, or unconfirmed
- Ability to run secret phrases through a substitution cipher (of which there are 100 by default) to obfuscate dictionary words

## Installation

To install Nxs, copy the directory to the `webapps/root` directory of the Nxt Client and rename it to `nxs`. Then, open `etc/webdefault.xml` and add this:

	<init-param>
		<param-name>relativeResourceBase</param-name>
		<param-value>/nxs</param-value>
    </init-param>

Run Nxt from the command line and open the web app it (at `http://localhost:7874` by default). The new Nxs Client should now display.

## Unlocking an Account

You may type a secret phrase to unlock an account. Please choose something secure. 50+ characters is recommended. Clicking the `Show Phrase` checkbox will show your secret phrase as you type it so you may check it for mistakes. Otherwise, the characters will be hidden as you type them. You may set a secret phrase hint in the config file in `assets/js/config.js`. This may help you to remember your secret phrase. Do not use something specific enough to help someone else figure out your secret phrase should your computer ever become breached. If the hint is used, it should be somewhat vague. There is also a `Generate` button to randomly generate a new account secret phrase for you and a `Cipher` button with available substitution ciphers. This can be useful if you are using a unique phrase of dictionary words which you would like to obfuscate through substitution.

**"Q": Show QR Code**

To show the QR code of the currently unlocked account, you may press the `Q` key.

## Automatically Unlocking an Account on Startup

In `assets/js/config.js`, you may set a secret phrase to unlock an account with on startup.

> **Warning:** This feature should only be used when testing accounts with small balances because of the security risk with your account that using this feature creates. Do not use this feature for accounts with anything more than a petty balance.

## Security and Trust of Nxs

Because Nxs is third-party software that works with the official Nxt Client, you should be skeptical at first and audit the code for yourself (you should be able to audit all of the javascript code for remote ajax requests in the span of about 10 minutes). The community should be diligent in checking that the Nxs code is doing what it claims to be doing and also to extend the same diligence and skepticism towards any forks of Nxs that are developed by others. It should go without saying that financial software requires careful analysis to prevent theft.

With that said, I am putting Nxs out under my real name (Cody Jassman) and am personally endorsing the product and making the claim that there is absolutely no nefarious motive to Nxs. I have created Nxs because I believe in the Nxt cryptocurrency and want to offer my web development skills to further the ease-of-use and available features that the Nxt Client offers. I acknowledge that jQuery's $.ajax() method is used twice: once in `assets/js/language.js` and once in `assets/js/cipher.js`, but the requests are being made to local `JSON` files that contains the labels and messages for the selected language in `assets/js/config.js` and the array of available substitution ciphers for your secret phrases. You should never see an `xmlhttprequest` call being made to a remote server of any kind.

You should also, as mentioned above, avoid the use of the `secretPhrase` setting in the config file except for testing purposes or working with small balances that you do not fear losing.

**Generating New Secret Phrases**

You may generate a new secret phrase by clicking the `Generate` button in the bottom right of the secret phrase field. The default length, set in the config file, is 50 characters. This feature uses a simple Javascript function that uses Math.random() for each character it adds to the secret phrase.

**Using Substitution Ciphers**

You can use any of the 100 predefined substitution ciphers to obscure your secret phrase if it is made up of dictionary words. To cipher your typed-in secret phrase, click the `Cipher` button in the bottom right of the secret phrase field. You may now click one of the numbers to use that substitution cipher. The keys can be found in `assets/json/cipher/keys.json`. You may also generate your own unique substitution ciphers with the `Cipher.createKeys()` Javascript function. If you do this, it is recommended you save them in a JSON file at `assets/json/cipher/keys-custom.json` and then change the `Secret Phrase - Cipher Custom Keys` variable in the config file to `true`. This way, you are less likely to overwrite your custom keys file when you upgrade Nxs. To further ensure you don't overwrite your custom keys file, you should be sure to backup this file.
